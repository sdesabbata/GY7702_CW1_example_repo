# Introduction 

This document was created to meet the requirements of GY7702 R for Data Science at University of Leicester. It was designed and created in R Markdown, a markup language that allows users to create documents that can be formatted to embed code blocks, code outputs and hyperlinks.When the R Markdown file is compiled, the markup language is hidden and the document is displayed in plain text.

This content was created using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/), [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

### Note to reader

Where a function is mentioned for the **first time**, a brief explanation will be given before the code block. 
Thereafter, this explanation will be dismissed. 



# Question 1

A vector of 25 numbers between 1 and 7 are listed below. These values represent
answers to a survey question 

```{r}
## NA 3 4 4 5 2 4 NA 6 3 5 4 0 5 7 5 NA 5 2 4 NA 3 3 5 NA
```

*  1 = Completely disagree
*  2 = Disagree
*  3 = Somehow disagree
*  4 = Neither agree or disagree
*  5 = Somehow agree
*  6 = Agree
*  7 = Completely agree
* NA = missing value


## Question 1.1 

Write the code necessary to check whether all participants to the survey either 
completely disagree or completely agree, once the missing values are excluded

 
```{r}
#code
```


```{r}
#code
```

## Question 1.2

**Write the code necessary to extract the indexes related to the participants 
in the survey who at least somehow agree or more.**

```{r}
#code
```


# Question 2

...

# Question 3

... 

# Question 4 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```
